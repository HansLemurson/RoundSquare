# RoundSquare
This is a tileset for Freeciv designed to have clean un-cluttered graphics. 
30x30 pixel size, Overhead view.

## History
Playing a Longturn game recently, I found out two important things:

* Viewing a map this large requires a 30x30 tileset.
* Trident makes my eyes bleed 

So I embarked on an epic quest of graphics editing, and lost a weekend or two in the seductive "Save changes, Reload tileset, Make new changes" production loop. Textures were remixed, pixels were tweaked, graphics transplanted, borders modified, layers were reverse-engineered, and countless changes were undone and redone. Everything was done with the purpose: Does this make the screen easier to read?

The result is a modified version of Trident with the rough edges smoothed, and some terrain graphics simplified, to reduce "Visual Clutter".
See if you can spot the difference!
